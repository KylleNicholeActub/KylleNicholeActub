- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KylleNicholeActub
- ðŸŒ± I have experience in Python, Java, CSS, HTML, VB.NET, and MySQL database management. My journey began with web development, where I used CSS and HTML to create responsive designs. I moved on to Python for its versatility, handling projects from web apps to automation scripts. Java has helped me build robust applications, and I've developed Windows applications using VB.NET. MySQL has been essential for managing and optimizing databases in various projects.

I am passionate about technology and continually strive to expand my skills. I am confident that my diverse experience can add value to any team.
